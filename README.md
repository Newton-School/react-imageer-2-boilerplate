# Image size-counter?

We have an image fo star with dimensions 300x300, and input with <code>id=growby-input</code> with default value 2
this value dictates by how much the image will grow on each click.

Example  for default case of 2.
each time we click on the star , it grows by 2px in height and width.

So initial dimensions
300x300
302x302 - after first click
304x304 - after second click
and so on

Example  for when <code>id=growby-input</code>  has value 5.
each time we click on the star , it grows by 2px in height and width.

So initial dimensions
300x300
302x302 - after first click
304x304 - after second click
and so on
